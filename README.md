# Bioinformatics Portfolio: Rosalind Problem Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to a curated set of bioinformatics problems from the Rosalind platform. This project was undertaken as part of my preparation for postgraduate study in Bioinformatics and serves as a portfolio of my problem-solving and programming skills in Python.

Each problem is organised into its own directory, which includes the Python source code and a detailed README.md file explaining the biological context, my computational approach, and instructions for running the script.

## Solved Problems
The problems I have solved cover a range of fundamental bioinformatics concepts, from basic sequence manipulation to more complex algorithmic challenges involving graph theory and computational pipelines.

### Foundational Skills
* DNA - Counting DNA Nucleotides

* RNA - Transcribing DNA into RNA

* REVC - Complementing a Strand of DNA

* GC - Computing GC Content

* PROT - Translating RNA into Protein

### Algorithmic Thinking
* HAMM - Counting Point Mutations

* SUBS - Finding a Motif in DNA

* GRPH - Overlap Graphs

### Bioinformatics Applications
* SPLC - RNA Splicing

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to translate biological problems into functional code, implement key bioinformatics algorithms, and build multi-step pipelines to process sequence data.
